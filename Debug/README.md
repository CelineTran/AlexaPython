## Debug

In this assignment you will create a new skill called "Coded Trivia" 

Once the skill has been built, copy the `model.json` file in this repository and paste it in the __JSON Editor__ under the __Interaction Model__ on the __Build__ Tab. 

Then copy the `lambda_function.py` into the __Code__ tab. 

Save both ends and start debugging!
